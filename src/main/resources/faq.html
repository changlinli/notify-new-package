<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Q: How is this different from <a href="release-monitoring.org">release-monitoring.org</a>?</h3>

<p>Fedora's <a href="release-monitoring.org">release-monitoring.org</a> is a great resource with tens of thousands of packages that it continually updates.
    Its scraping of package homepages is what powers this website; this service does no scraping of its own.
    However, while the Fedora ecosystem does provide the ability to get email notifications for package updates,
    it may not be immediately obvious how to do so.
    It requires looking up the package you want on <a href="release-monitoring.org">release-monitoring.org</a>, creating a <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/">Fedora FAS account</a>, then going to
    <a href="http://apps.fedoraproject.org/notifications/">http://apps.fedoraproject.org/notifications/</a>
    and then setting up custom filters there.
</p>

<p>
    If you know where to look, this is not terribly onerous, the entire process takes maybe five minutes.
    However, if all you want is email notifications of new package versions, there's
    no reason it should be any more complicated than a single form with two fields:
    a package field, and an email address field.
    That's what this project is! Removing all the accidental complexity so that you just have those two boxes.
</p>

<h3>Q: Is there any official relationship between this project and <a href="release-monitoring.org">release-monitoring.org</a>?</h3>

<p>This is just a fun one-man side project.
    This project has not received any official endorsement from the maintainers of
    <a href="release-monitoring.org">release-monitoring.org</a>. In fact I would be
    mildly surprised if they'd heard of this website. This service just
    subscribes to the public AMQP brokers that <a href="release-monitoring.org">release-monitoring.org</a>
    graciously provides.</p>

<h3>Q: What if I want to add a new package which currently does not exist?</h3>

<p>To add a package you'll need to use <a href="release-monitoring.org">release-monitoring.org</a> directly,
    which means you'll probably want an account with <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/">Fedora FAS</a>
    if you don't already have one. If your package already uses GitHub, GitLab, or
    BitBucket for releases or is a package on npm, PyPI, Rubygems, crates.io,
    Hackage, etc., once you have an account set up, it is often a matter of seconds to create a new package.</p>

<h3>Q: Do you share my email address with any other services?</h3>

<p>No! Absolutely not. Your email addresses are never shared with any other
    party and certainly are not sent off to be harvested in some giant email
    list somewhere.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I remove my email address from this service?</h3>

<p>Simply unsubscribe to all package notifications you are currently unsubscribed to. Your email address will be automatically deleted within an hour.</p>

<h3>Q: If I don't remember which packages I'm subscribed to, or otherwise am having difficulties unsubscribing what can I do?</h3>

<p>Please email admin at the URL of this website detailing the problems you're running into and I'll do my best to help you out.</p>

<h3>Q: Where is the source code for this service?</h3>

<p>The source code for this lives at <a href="https://github.com/changlinli/notify-new-package">https://github.com/changlinli/notify-new-package</a>.</p>
